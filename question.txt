1. choose an appropriate data (or input) and implement the following problems using greedy algorithm.
The implementation should be general which can work with any set of input.

a) Huffman coding.
b) minimum sum of products of two arrays.
c) Kruskalls minimum spanning tree.
d) Prims minimum spanning tree.

2. create a left skewed binary tree with a minimum height 4. create a height balanced tree from the already
created binary tree search any two data in this two trees and find the number of comparisons in these searches.

3. implement the non recursive solution for inorder, preorder and postorder traversals in tree.

4. implement the travelling salesman problem using branch and bound method.
